# Test Dataset

This project brings together all source metadata and content that make up the Europeana test dataset.

The dataset is designed as a central repository of test records that represent concrete use cases supported by Europeana products and services.

The records included in the Europeana test dataset serve a dual purpose:
* they provide concrete examples for documentation, demonstrations, and the onboarding of data providers; and
* they function as test cases to support development, quality assurance, and the ongoing validation of Europeana’s tools and services.
